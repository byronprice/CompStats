function [X] = SWEEP(X,k)
%SWEEP.m  Project 2, 2-b
%   Code to evaluate the SWEEP operator on row k of matrix X
%Inputs: 
%        X - a matrix, n-by-p
%        k - the row number on which to evaluate the operator, k<=n
%
%Outputs: 
%        X - the matrix after performing the SWEEP operator on row k
